# School District Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to calculate and examine various performance metrics for 15 schools in a district. This is a very practical analysis, as the super intendent of a school district must ensure that all schools under their purview are meeting standards in terms of student performance. Additionally, it was discovered that the 9th grade scores at Thomas High School may be corrupted by academic dishonesty. These tainted scores were removed from the data and the analysis was performed on the clean data to see what effect the Thomas High School 9th grade scores had on the entire dataset.
